For this first part of the project, only the graphic part of the CSS layout is required.

In the second part, JavaScript will be added.

### Prerequisites

The functional requirements are as follows:

RF1 - The user must be able to start a new game by entering their
name and choosing the game mode (human vs human or human vs machine).

RF2 - When starting a new game a 3x3 board will be created with the default values.

### Installing

I initially created several HTML pages concatenated together.
The Index with the Input pages, then I created the central part of the board, and finally the Winner pop-up.

Through the use of CSS I modelled the layout.

I've installed a specific font called KA1, I used some icons for Vector Icons page.

Second part of the project, using the method SPA, Single Page Application, I did delete all the HTML pages except Index.html, and integrated the html with Javascript.
Different javascript pages have been created for each section of the game.

Added also the movement on the board game with X and O.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Classic Tic Tac Toe game. 
Choose whether to play against an opponent or the Bot,
enter your name and start playing. Touching the squares will mark X (in the case of a second player O).
